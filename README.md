🧠 Projects Repository

Welcome to my Projects repository!
This repo contains a collection of machine learning and data science projects I’ve created to explore different algorithms, datasets, and problem statements.

🚀 Overview

Each project in this repository demonstrates practical applications of machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation techniques.
The goal is to learn, experiment, and improve prediction accuracy across various domains.

📂 Projects Included

Here are some of the projects currently available (more coming soon!):

🩺 Diabetes Prediction – Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on health parameters.

🚗 Car Price Prediction – Estimates car prices using regression techniques.

🏠 House Price Prediction – Predicts property prices based on key features.

💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection – Detects fraudulent transactions using classification models.

🍷 Wine Quality Prediction – Predicts wine quality using physicochemical data.
