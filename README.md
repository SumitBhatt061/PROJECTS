🧠 Machine Learning & Reinforcement Learning Projects

Welcome to my project repository!
This repo contains multiple end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations, each built to explore different algorithms, datasets, and problem-solving techniques.

📂 Projects Included
1️⃣ Breast Cancer Classification

A supervised learning project to classify tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Key Features

Data preprocessing & exploration

Feature scaling

Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression / SVM / Random Forest

Performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix & ROC

2️⃣ Diabetes Prediction

A machine-learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on health-related features.

Key Features

Data cleaning & handling missing values

EDA with visualizations

Training models such as Random Forest, SVM, KNN

Metric evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall

3️⃣ Teach a Taxi with Reinforcement Learning (OpenAI Gym – Taxi-v3)

An RL project where an agent learns to pick up and drop off passengers efficiently using Q-Learning.

Key Features
