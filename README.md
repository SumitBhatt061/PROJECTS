📂 Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository!
This repo contains multiple end-to-end ML projects built using Python, Colab, and popular ML libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

Each notebook focuses on solving a real-world problem using machine learning techniques such as classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning.

📘 Projects Included
1️⃣ Breast Cancer Classification

Predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

Techniques used: Data preprocessing, feature scaling, classification models, evaluation metrics.

2️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction

Predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to leave the service.

Includes handling categorical data, feature engineering, model training, and accuracy evaluation.

3️⃣ Diabetes Prediction

Uses medical features to classify whether a person has diabetes.

Involves EDA, data cleaning, train-test split, ML classification algorithms.

4️⃣ Teach a Taxi with Reinforcement Learning

A fun RL project that trains a taxi agent to pick and drop passengers using Q-learning.

Shows state-action spaces, Q-table updates, and visualization.
